## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Create Environment
```bash
conda create -n D-MoLE python=3.10 -y
conda activate D-MoLE
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install uv package manager
pip install uv

# Install project in development mode
uv pip install -e .
```

### 3. Install Flash Attention
```bash
# Install flash-attention (pre-compiled wheel for CUDA 12 + PyTorch 2.6)
uv pip install https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/download/v2.7.4.post1/flash_attn-2.7.4.post1+cu12torch2.6cxx11abiFALSE-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
```

### 4. Install Other Requirements
```bash
uv pip install opencv-python imageio decord pycocoevalcap wandb datasets
conda install openjdk=8 -y  # for pycocoevalcap
```

## 📁 Data Preparation

### Download Datasets

📥 **[Download from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a3pKtWgkkWCiVRttQT8rMW9RvXYvZywh/view?usp=sharing)**

1. **Download datasets** from the Google Drive link above and organize them in the following structure:
```
data/
├── flickr30k/
│   ├── Images/
│   ├── flickr30k_test_karpathy.jsonl
│   └── train.jsonl
├── vizwiz/
├── textcaps/
├── iconqa/
├── ocrvqa/
├── kvqa/
├── pmcvqa/
└── skvg/
```

2. **Download pretrained model** and place it at:
```
pretrained/
└── InternVL2-2B/
```

## 🧪 Run Experiments

We provide the complete D-MoLE training and evaluation pipeline.

### Step 1: Preprocessing
```bash
# Compute sequence representations and train autoencoder
bash scripts/preprocess/compute_seq_rep.sh
python scripts/preprocess/train_autoencoder.py
```

### Step 2: Architecture Search
```bash
# Compute zero-cost proxy scores and generate D-MoLE architecture
bash scripts/preprocess/compute_zc_score.sh
python scripts/preprocess/get_dmole_arch.py
```

### Step 3: Training
```bash
# Train D-MoLE model
bash scripts/train/dmole.sh

# Baseline: Sequential LoRA fine-tuning
bash scripts/train/seq_lora.sh
```

### Step 4: Evaluation
```bash
# Evaluation is enabled by default in the training scripts
# Or you can manually run evaluation using:
bash run_eval.sh
# This supports both pretrained mode and continual mode
```

You can modify these scripts to customize the base model, tasks, and other configurations.
